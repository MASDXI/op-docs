# Compatible Tokens

<Warning>
SuperchainERC20 tokens are currently in active development and not yet available in production.
</Warning>

SuperchainERC20 tokens are a new token standard that enables native cross-chain functionality within the Superchain. These tokens can move seamlessly between OP Stack chains without the need for traditional bridges.

## What are SuperchainERC20 Tokens?

SuperchainERC20 tokens extend the standard ERC20 interface to support native cross-chain transfers. They maintain the same properties as regular ERC20 tokens while adding the ability to:

- Move between chains via native minting and burning
- Maintain consistent total supply across the Superchain
- Avoid liquidity fragmentation issues
- Provide better user experience than wrapped tokens

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Native Cross-Chain" icon="link">
    No bridges required - tokens move via native minting/burning
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Supply" icon="balance-scale">
    Total supply remains constant across all chains
  </Card>
  <Card title="ERC20 Compatible" icon="check-circle">
    Maintains full compatibility with existing ERC20 infrastructure
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Liquidity Fragmentation" icon="droplet">
    Eliminates the need for wrapped tokens and liquidity pools
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How They Work

SuperchainERC20 tokens implement a mint-and-burn mechanism:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Transfer">
    User initiates a cross-chain transfer on the source chain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Burn on Source">
    Tokens are burned on the source chain, reducing local supply
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cross-Chain Message">
    A cross-chain message is sent to the destination chain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint on Destination">
    Tokens are minted on the destination chain for the recipient
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits Over Traditional Bridges

<Accordion title="No Liquidity Requirements">
  Traditional bridges require liquidity pools on both chains. SuperchainERC20 tokens eliminate this requirement through native minting and burning.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reduced Complexity">
  No need to manage wrapped tokens or multiple token contracts across chains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Better Security">
  Eliminates bridge-related security risks by using native chain functionality.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Improved UX">
  Users interact with the same token contract interface across all chains.
</Accordion>

## Implementation

SuperchainERC20 tokens implement additional interface functions:

```solidity
interface ISuperchainERC20 {
    function crosschainMint(address to, uint256 amount) external;
    function crosschainBurn(address from, uint256 amount) external;
    
    event CrosschainMint(address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    event CrosschainBurn(address indexed from, uint256 amount);
}
```

## Token Migration

Existing ERC20 tokens can be migrated to SuperchainERC20:

1. **Deploy SuperchainERC20 Version**: Create a new version of your token with SuperchainERC20 interface
2. **Migration Contract**: Deploy a migration contract to handle the conversion
3. **User Migration**: Users can migrate their tokens to the new SuperchainERC20 version
4. **Gradual Transition**: Both versions can coexist during the transition period
