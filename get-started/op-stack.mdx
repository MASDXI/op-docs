# Getting Started with the OP Stack

**The OP Stack is the standardized, shared, and open-source development stack that powers Optimism, maintained by the Optimism Collective.**

## What is the OP Stack?

The OP Stack consists of the many different software components managed and maintained by the Optimism Collective that, together, form the backbone of Optimism. The OP Stack is built as a public good for the Ethereum and Optimism ecosystems.

## The OP Stack Powers Optimism

The OP Stack is the set of software that powers Optimism â€” currently in the form of the software behind OP Mainnet and eventually in the form of the Optimism Superchain and its governance.

With the advent of the Superchain concept, it has become increasingly important for Optimism to easily support the secure creation of new chains that can interoperate within the proposed Superchain ecosystem.

## Current State: Bedrock Release

Optimism Bedrock is the current iteration of the OP Stack. The Bedrock release provides the tools for launching a production-quality Optimistic Rollup blockchain.

### Key Features

- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested infrastructure powering OP Mainnet
- **Superchain Compatible**: Built to work with the upcoming Superchain network
- **Optimistic Rollup**: Leverages optimistic execution for scalability
- **Ethereum Compatible**: Full EVM compatibility for easy migration

## The OP Stack Tomorrow

The OP Stack is an evolving concept. As Optimism grows, so will the OP Stack.

### Future Developments

- **Enhanced Modularity**: Easier to plug in and configure different modules
- **Superchain Integration**: Message-passing infrastructure for seamless interoperability
- **New Layer Types**: Support for different execution environments and consensus mechanisms

## Stack Layers

The OP Stack can be thought of as software components that either help define a specific layer of the Optimism ecosystem or fill a role as a module within an existing layer.
