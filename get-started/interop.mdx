# Get Started with Superchain Interoperability

<Warning>
Superchain interoperability is currently in active development and not yet available in production.
</Warning>

Superchain interoperability is the next major scalability improvement to the OP Stack that enables a network of chains, the Superchain, to feel like a single blockchain.

## What is Superchain Interoperability?

Superchain interoperability is a set of protocols and services that lets OP Stack blockchains read each other's state. It provides:

- **Native Asset Movement**: ETH and ERC-20 tokens move securely between chains via native minting and burning
- **Cross-Chain Composability**: Apps can compose with data that exists on other chains  
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Applications can scale across multiple chains seamlessly

## Key Benefits

## Architecture Overview

Superchain interoperability is enabled by a new service called **OP Supervisor** that every node operator runs alongside their existing infrastructure:

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph "OP Stack Chain"
    node[OP Node]
    super[OP-Supervisor]
    geth[Execution Engine]
    node<-->super--->geth<-->node
  end
  
  subgraph "Other Chains"
    chain2[Chain #2]
    chain3[Chain #3]
    l1[L1 Consensus]
  end

  chain2-->|log events|super
  chain3-->|log events|super
  l1-->|block status|super
```

## How Cross-Chain Messages Work

Cross-chain messages require two transactions:

1. **Initiating Message**: A transaction on the source chain creates a log event
2. **Executing Message**: A transaction on the destination chain calls `CrossL2Inbox` to execute or verify the message

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Initiating Message">
    Execute a transaction on the source chain that emits a log event
  </Step>
  <Step title="Message Propagation">
    OP-Supervisor detects the log event and validates it happened on the source chain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Message">
    Call `CrossL2Inbox` on the destination chain to execute the cross-chain message
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Safety Levels

Superchain interop introduces new safety levels for blocks:

- **Local Safe**: Block is written to L1
- **Cross Safe**: Block and all its dependencies are written to L1
- **Unsafe**: Block is shared via gossip protocol but not yet on L1

<Note>
Unsafe blocks require additional trust assumptions in the sequencer dependency set.
