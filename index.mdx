# Welcome to the Optimism Docs

Welcome to the Optimism Docs, the unified home of the [Optimism Collective's](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/?utm_source=op-docs&utm_medium=docs) technical documentation and information about the [OP Stack](/stack/getting-started).

Information about the Optimism Collective's governance, community, and mission can be found on the [Optimism Community Hub](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/?utm_source=op-docs&utm_medium=docs).

## Grow your app with Superchain interoperability! ðŸŒŸ

Superchain interoperability is the next major scalability improvement to the OP Stack which enables a network of chains, the Superchain, to feel like a single blockchain. Superchain interoperability unlocks 1-block latency, trust minimized cross-chain composability and enables ETH and ERC-20 tokens to move securely between chains via native minting and burning as well as smart contracts to compose with data across multiple chains.

Superchain interop is in active development. [Learn how you can leverage Superchain interoperability to tap into Superchain network effects](/interop/explainer).

## About Optimism

The OP Stack is the standardized, shared, and open-source development stack that makes it easy to spin up your own production-ready Layer 2 blockchain. The Superchain is a network of OP Stack chains that share a bridging protocol, governance system, and more.
