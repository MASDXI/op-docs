# Chain Operators

Chain operators deploy and manage their own OP Stack blockchains. This guide covers everything you need to know to run a successful OP Stack chain.

## What is a Chain Operator?

A chain operator is responsible for deploying and maintaining an OP Stack blockchain. This includes:

- Deploying smart contracts
- Running sequencer infrastructure
- Managing chain parameters
- Coordinating upgrades
- Monitoring chain health

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan Your Chain">
    Define your chain's purpose, target users, and requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Infrastructure">
    Deploy the necessary infrastructure components
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Contracts">
    Deploy the OP Stack smart contracts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Your Chain">
    Start the sequencer and begin processing transactions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Responsibilities

### Infrastructure Management
- **Sequencer**: Order and batch transactions
- **Proposer**: Submit state roots to L1
- **Batcher**: Post transaction data to L1
- **Challenger**: Monitor for invalid state roots (fault proofs)

### Chain Configuration
- **Gas Parameters**: Set gas limits and pricing
- **Block Configuration**: Configure block size and timing
- **Fee Parameters**: Set L1 and L2 fee structures
- **Upgrade Management**: Coordinate protocol upgrades
