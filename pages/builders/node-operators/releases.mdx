# Node software releases

This page gives information about the node software releases and how they're versioned. Our latest releases, notes, and changelogs can be found on GitHub. `op-node` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) and `op-geth` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases). We always recommend you run the latest release versions of the node software.

## Releases versioning

Production releases are always tags, versioned as `<component-name>/v<semver>`. For example, an `op-node` release might be versioned as `op-node/v1.10.3`. Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.10.3`, indicate releases of all Go code only and DO NOT include smart contracts. This naming scheme is required by Golang. In the above list, these `v<semver>` releases contain all `op-*` components and exclude all `contracts-*` components.

`op-geth` embeds upstream geth's version inside its own version as follows: `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`. Basically, geth's version is our minor version. For example, if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding `op-geth` version would be `v1.101200.0`. Note that we pad out to three characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch version. Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not padded.
