Crypto used to be full of wild ideas—where are they now? Creativity and composability has been limited up until now. We’ve mastered wallets, DeFi, L2s, and stables. It’s time to bring back the bold. Discover net-new use cases that are uniquely enabled by Superchain Interop, and not just bridge abstraction.

It’s time to reimagine the onchain future together, reimagine your application with Superchain Interop and hack on Superchain Interop devnets. 

## Cutting edge Superchain ideas

Hack on the various cutting edge applications that are uniquely enabled by Superchain Interop. We've compiled a list of Superchain interop ideas that you can use to help grow the Superchain

If you’ve experimented with an application, or library to support Superchain Interop, [please let us know and fill out this form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/398MYD9). We would love to reach out directly to provide technical and potential marketing support. You can also tag @Optimism on Twitter.
