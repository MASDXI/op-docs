# Asterisc

Asterisc is an alternative fault-proof VM for OP Stack that proves execution of a RISC-V program with an interactive fraud-proof.

The interface of the Asterisk binary is essentially the same as Cannon for op-challenger compatibility; therefore, the binary commands implementation is based on [Cannon](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/cannon).

*Deploy/run this at your own risk, this is highly experimental software*

## Work in progress

This project is a work in progress. Maybe 80% complete.

## Getting started

- Read the [docs](./docs).
- Build the smart-contracts with foundry.
- Compile the `tests/go-tests` (see [`Makefile`](./tests/go-tests/Makefile)) for binaries used by Go tests.
- Run the `rvgo` tests. All onchain and offchain execution is covered by standard RISC-V unit-tests

## How does it work?

Interactively different parties can agree on a common prefix of the execution trace states,
and the execution first step where things are different.

Asterisc produces the commitments to the memory, register, CSR and VM state during the execution trace,
and emulates the disputed step inside the EVM to determine the correct state after.

Asterisc consists of two parts:
- `rvgo`: Go implementation of Risc-V emulator with tooling
  - Fast-mode: Emulate 1 instruction per step, directly on a VM state
  - Slow-mode: Emulate 1 instruction per step, on a VM state-oracle.
  - Tooling: merkleize VM state, collect access-list of a slow-mode step, diff VM merkle-trees
- `rvsol`: Solidity/Yul mirror of Go Risc-V slow-mode step that runs with access-list as input

All VM register state is compact enough to be proven as a single preimage, with a binary merkle-tree for 64-bit memory.

### Why use Yul in solidity?

The use of YUL / "solidity assembly" is very convenient because:
- it offers pretty `switch` statements
- it uses function calls, no operators, that can be mirrored exactly in Go
- it preserves underflow/overflow behavior: this is a feature, not a bug, when emulating an ALU and registers.
- it operates on unsigned word-sized integers only: no typed data, just like registers don't have types.
  - In Go it is typed `U64` and `U256` for sanity, but it's all `uint256` words in slow mode.

### Why fast and slow mode?

Emulating a program on top of a merkleized state structure is expensive.
When bisecting a program trace, you only need to produce a commitment to a few intermediate states, not all of them.

Note that slow mode and fast mode ALUs can be implemented *exactly the same*, just with different u64/u256 implementations.
The slow mode matches the smart-contract behavior 1:1 and is useful for building the memory merkle-proof
and having a Go mirror of the smart-contract behavior for testing/debugging in general.

## RISC-V subset support

- `RV32I` support - 32 bit base instruction set
  - `FENCE`, `ECALL`, `EBREAK` are hardwired to implement a minimal subset of systemcalls of the linux kernel
    - Work in progress. All syscalls used by the Golang `risc64` runtime. 
- `RV64I` support
- `RV32M`+`RV64M`: Multiplication support
- `RV32A`+`RV64A`: Atomics support
- `RV{32,64}{D,F,Q}`: no-op: No floating points support (since no IEEE754 determinism with rounding modes etc., nor worth the complexity)
- `Zifencei`: `FENCE.I` no-op: No need for `FENCE.I`
- `Zicsr`: no-op: some support for Control-and-status registers may come later though.
- `Ztso`: no-op: no need for Total Store Ordering
- `RVC`: compact instructions - work-in-progress, to support Rust compiler output.
- other: revert with error code on unrecognized instructions

Where necessary, the non-supported operations are no-ops that allow execution of the standard Go runtime, with disabled GC.

# Go support

To run Go, we must support a RISC-V runtime in Go.

[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) has nice minimal riscv [targets](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/blob/release/targets/riscv64.json) with small largely-optional runtime for embedded systems,
but is not mature enough.

Another path forward in the future may be to implement an alternative `riscv64_ethereum` runtime in Go,
largely based on the javascript "OS" from the `wasm_js` runtime, to make a lot of system interaction no-ops,
and to fake concurrency with the weird parking/recovering that is done there.

So instead of forking the Go runtime, or using a fork like TinyGo,
for now we can try to support the `riscv64_linux` runtime of the official Go compiler.


## Initialization

Steps:
1. Compile Go with `riscv64_linux` target
2. Take ELF binary output, and concatenate all sections, with filling to mem-size etc. where necessary: i.e. pre-process the ELF-loader steps.
3. If concurrency is not supported, we must replicate the hack from geohotz in Cannon to make the GC start function in the Go runtime a no-op, 
   during the ELF processing this can be done based on inspection of program symbols and patching `runtime.gcenable` to immediately jump to the address in the return-address register (`ra`).
4. Prepare the stack:
   - After `0x7f_ff_d0_00` in memory, lay out the stack:
     - `argc = 0`
     - `argv[n] = 0`
     - `envp[term] = 0`
     - `auxv[0] = _AT_PAGESZ = 6`
     - `auxv[1] = 4 KiB = 4096`
     - `auxv[2] = _AT_RANDOM = 25`
     - `auxv[3] = address to 16 bytes of randomness`
     - `auxv[term] = 0`
     - `16 bytes of randomness`
   - Initialize stack pointer to top of stack
5. Merkleize the binary, this will be the cartridge we slot into the VM

## AUX vectors used by Go

See [`os_linux.go`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1a9893a969e0a73dc4f1e48ed40ccaf29ec238a6/src/runtime/os_linux.go#L215):
- `_AT_NULL`: End of vector
- `_AT_PAGESZ = 6`: System physical page size. Go requires [4KB minimum physical page size](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1a09d57de58a90987789ef637083aac21533eeb7/src/runtime/mheap.go#L23).
- `_AT_HWCAP  = 16`, `_AT_HWCAP2 = 26`: hardware capability bit vector, and vector 2:
  The `internal/cpu` package in Go uses these to determine abilities like AES, SHA2, etc.
  However, the RISC-V target doesn't support any hardware accelerated functions,
  [the `doinit()` is empty](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/feb984c96b10900daade4b47c4d308d7dd4ed5c3/src/internal/cpu/cpu_riscv64.go#L9).
- `_AT_RANDOM = 25`: The `AT_RANDOM` vector is a pointer to 16 bytes of data, initialized by the Go runtime
  [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/db36eca33c389871b132ffb1a84fd534a349e8d8/src/runtime/os_linux.go#L284)
  to [initialize](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/0b323a3c1690050340fc8e39730a07bb01373f0a/src/runtime/proc.go#L867)
  the "fast random" with, i.e. the randomness used by maps iteration, as well as the `hashkey` used by `hash{32,64}.go`


## Linux syscalls used by Go

The Go runtime defines the following linux syscalls to be used by Go:
[`sys_linux_riscv64.s`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/sys_linux_riscv64.s)

And table of all syscalls:
https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/zsysnum_linux_riscv64.go
Note that some are available to std-lib, but not used by the runtime, and thus present here but not in the runtime bindings.

To read the Go assembler, see [this Go asm syntax doc](https://go.dev/doc/asm) (it's not as complete, but one of few resources).

By supporting a minimal subset of these, most Go programs can be proven.
The GC won't have to be disabled if concurrency is supported, and will then avoid growing the memory indefinitely.

Note that hardware-accelerated AES hashing is not supported by the riscv64 runtime,
fallback functions [are used instead](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/0b323a3c1690050340fc8e39730a07bb01373f0a/src/runtime/asm_riscv64.s#L222). 

Errors and file descriptor flags used by the syscalls can be found in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/zerrors_linux_riscv64.go
