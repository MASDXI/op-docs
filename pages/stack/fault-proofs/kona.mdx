# FPVM: Kona

Kona is an alternative fault-proof program for the OP Stack, providing a Rust-based implementation to complement the Asterisc fault-proof VM. Together, they form an equivalent system to Cannon and op-program but with distinct architectural and implementation differences.


## Overview

Kona works as the fault-proof program within the Asterisc fault-proof system. It operates by executing program logic step-by-step and generating commitments for every state transition. These commitments allow disputing parties to identify and resolve divergences in execution traces through interactive fraud proofs.

Key features of Kona include:

*   **Written in Rust:** High performance and memory safety.
*   **Optimized for Asterisc:** Specifically tailored to work with the Asterisc RISC-V-based fault-proof VM.
*   **Deterministic Execution:** Ensures consistency in state transitions during disputes.

Kona + Asterisc is analogous to Cannon + op-program, providing an alternative pathway to secure optimistic rollups.

## Relationship to Asterisc

Kona is designed to:

*   Complement Asterisc, which serves as the RISC-V fault-proof VM.
*   Validate execution traces using the interactive fraud-proof mechanism.
*   Offer an alternative to the Cannon + op-program system, leveraging Rust and RISC-V for distinct performance characteristics.

For more on Asterisc, see the [Asterisc documentation](./asterisc.mdx).



## Key Differences

### Architecture

| System              | Fault-Proof VM | Fault-Proof Program | Language | Architecture |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Asterisc + Kona     | Asterisc       | Kona                | Rust     | RISC-V       |
| Cannon + op-program | Cannon         | op-program          | Go       | MIPS         |

### Performance

*   Kona benefits from Rust's memory safety and performance optimizations.
*   Asterisc uses RISC-V, offering a simpler and more adaptable instruction set.

## Getting Started

To set up and use Kona, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anton-rs/kona.git
    cd kona
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. Use `rustup` to set up Rust:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup install stable
    ```

3.  **Compile the Program:**
    Build the Kona fault-proof program:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

4.  **Run Tests:**
    Execute the test suite to verify your setup:
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

5.  **Explore Further Documentation:**
    Check the [Kona repo docs](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona) for advanced usage and implementation details.

## Benefits of Kona

1.  **Rust-Based Implementation:**
    *   Provides performance advantages and memory safety.

2.  **Integration with Asterisc:**
    *   Designed to fully utilize the RISC-V-based VM's capabilities.

3.  **Focused Functionality:**
    *   Tailored for the OP Stack's fault-proofing needs without additional complexity.

## Limitations

Kona is not a general-purpose program and is specifically designed for use within the Optimism fault-proofing stack. It does not support arbitrary RISC-V programs, focusing solely on its role as the fault-proof program for Asterisc.

Kona is currently in the experimental stage. While it provides a functional alternative, it may lack the maturity and stability of Cannon + op-program. Users are encouraged to contribute to its development and provide feedback.
