# Pausing the bridge

The [`OptimismPortal22`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v2.0.0-rc.1/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol) is the low-level L1 message passing contract present on all standard OP Stack chains.
This contract handles the L1 side of the communication channel between an OP Stack chain and its L1 parent chain.

As a safety mechanism, the `OptimismPortal2` contract can be configured to be pausable by a specific `GUARDIAN` address.
When paused, the `OptimismPortal2` contract will prevent L2-to-L1 transactions from being executed.
This is a backup safety mechanism that can be used to help mitigate potential active security concerns.

Pause functionality and [two-step withdrawals](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608050641/https://blog.oplabs.co/two-step-withdrawals/) were introduced to the OP Stack to mitigate the risk of withdrawal bugs that have led to exploits in other bridging systems.

## Pause functionality

The `OptimismPortal2` can be configured to allow a `GUARDIAN` address to pause and unpause L2-to-L1 transactions from being executed.
L2-to-L1 transactions allow users and smart contracts on the OP Stack chain to send messages to the L1 parent chain.
Pause functionality allows a `GUARDIAN` to halt L2-to-L1 transaction execution for the OP Stack chain in question.
L1-to-L2 transactions are not affected by pause functionality.

Pauses by the `GUARDIAN` impact all L2-to-L1 transactions for the OP Stack chain in question and cannot be targeted to specific users, smart contracts, or transactions.
Pauses are designed to be a backup safety mechanism and are expected to be used only in the event of an active pressing security concern.

## Pause and unpause functions

The `GUARDIAN` can pause and unpause L2-to-L1 transactions at any time by calling the [`pause`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/8d0dd96e494b2ba154587877351e87788336a4ec/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SuperchainConfig.sol#L74) and [`unpause`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L158-L163) functions on the `OptimismPortal2` contract.
Additional controls on the `GUARDIAN` address can be implemented by configuring the `GUARDIAN` as a smart contract.

## Guardian address

The `GUARDIAN` address is set as an variable inside of the `SuperchainConfig` contract.
