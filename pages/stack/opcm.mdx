# OP Contracts Manager

The OP Contracts Manager is a contract that deploys the L1 contracts for an OP Stack chain in a single transaction. It provides a minimal set of user-configurable parameters to ensure that the resulting chain meets the standard configuration requirements.

The version deployed is always a governance-approved contract release. The set of governance approved contract releases can be found on the Optimism Monorepo releases page, and is the set of releases named `op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`. It deploys the [Fault Proof System](/stack/fault-proofs/explainer), using the [PermissionedDisputeGame](/stack/smart-contracts#permissioneddisputegame).

## Purpose

OPCM simplifies the L1 contract deployments for new OP Stack chains. It addresses three aspects of deploying the OP Stack's L1 contracts:

1.  **Deploy Superchain Contracts.** Superchain contracts are shared between many OP chains, so this occurs only occasionally in production.
2.  **Deploy Shared Implementation Contracts.** This occurs once per contracts release in production.
3.  **Deploy OP Chain Contracts.** This occurs for every OP chain deployment in production.

In a future iteration, it also is meant to handle upgrading the smart contracts.
