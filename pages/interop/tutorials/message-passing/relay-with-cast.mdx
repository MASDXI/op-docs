## Overview

Learn to relay transactions directly by sending the correct transaction.

<details>
  <summary>About this tutorial</summary>

  **Prerequisite technical knowledge**

  *   Familiarity with blockchain concepts
  *   Familiarity with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), especially `cast`

  **What you'll learn**

  *   How to use `cast` to relay transactions when autorelay does not work

  **Development environment requirements**

  *   Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows)
  *   Node.js version 16 or higher
  *   Git for version control
  *   Supersim environment configured and running
  *   Foundry tools installed (forge, cast, anvil)
</details>

### What you'll build

*   A script to relay messages without using [the JavaScript library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/viem)

## Setup

<Steps>
  ### Run Supersim

  This exercise needs to be done on Supersim.
  You cannot use the devnets because you cannot disable autorelay on them.

  1.  Follow the [installation guide](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim/getting-started/installation).

  2.  Run Supersim *without* `--interop.relay`.

      ```sh
      ./supersim
      ```

  ### Create the state for relaying messages

  The results of this step are similar to what the [message passing tutorial](/interop/tutorials/message-passing) would produce if you did not have autorelay on.

  Execute this script.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-manual-relay.sh#L1-L147 hash=a63d72f58a06ca7ca78fd1592efcf4a3 
  ```
</Steps>

## Manually relay a message using `cast`

Run this script:

```sh
./manual-relay/sendAndRelay.sh
```

### Explanation

```sh
#! /bin/sh
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
USER_ADDRESS=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
URL_CHAIN_A=http://localhost:9545
URL_CHAIN_B=http://localhost:9546
GREETER_A_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
GREETER_B_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
CHAIN_ID_B=902
```

This is the configuration.
The greeter addresses are identical because the nonce for the user address has the same nonce on both chains.

```sh
cast send -q --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A $GREETER_A_ADDRESS "setGreeting(string)" "Hello from chain A $$"
```

Send a message from chain A to chain B. The `$$` is the process ID, so if you rerun the script you'll see that the information changes.

```sh
cast logs "SentMessage(uint256,address,uint256,address,bytes)" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A | tail -14 > log-entry
```

Whenever `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` sends a message to a different blockchain, it emits a [`SendMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L83-L91) event.
Extract only the latest `SendMessage` event from the logs.

```sh
TOPICS=`cat log-entry | grep -A4 topics | awk '{print $1}' | tail -4 | sed 's/0x//'`
TOPICS=`echo $TOPICS | sed 's/ //g'`
```

Consolidate the log topics into a single hex string.

```sh
ORIGIN=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023
BLOCK_NUMBER=`cat log-entry | awk '/blockNumber/ {print $2}'`
LOG_INDEX=`cat log-entry | awk '/logIndex/ {print $2}'`
TIMESTAMP=`cast block $BLOCK_NUMBER --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A | awk '/timestamp/ {print $2}'`
CHAIN_ID_A=`cast chain-id --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A`
SENT_MESSAGE=`cat log-entry | awk '/data/ {print $2}'`
```

Read additional fields from the log entry.

```sh
LOG_ENTRY=0x`echo $TOPICS$SENT_MESSAGE | sed 's/0x//'`
```

Consolidate the entire log entry.

```sh
RPC_PARAMS=$(cat <<INNER_END_OF_FILE
{
    "origin": "$ORIGIN",
    "blockNumber": "$BLOCK_NUMBER",
    "logIndex": "$LOG_INDEX",
    "timestamp": "$TIMESTAMP",
    "chainId": "$CHAIN_ID_A",
    "payload": "$LOG_ENTRY"
}
INNER_END_OF_FILE
)

ACCESS_LIST=`cast rpc admin_getAccessListForIdentifier --rpc-url http://localhost:8420 "$RPC_PARAMS" | jq .accessList`
```

To secure cross-chain messaging and prevent potential [denial-of-service attacks](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/blob/main/protocol/interop-access-list.md), relay transactions require properly formatted access lists that include a checksum derived from the message data.
This lets sequencers know what executing messages to expect in a transaction, which makes it easy not to include transactions that are invalid because they rely on messages that were never sent.

The [algorithm to calculate the access list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol#L87-L115) is a bit complicated, but you don't need to worry about it.
Supersim exposes [RPC calls](https://supersim.pages.dev/guides/interop/cast?highlight=manuall#7-construct-the-access-list-for-the-message) that calculates it for you on port 8420.
The code above will calculate the correct access list even if you're using a different interop cluster where autorelay is not functioning. 
This is because the code implements a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), which produces consistent results regardless of external state.
In contrast, the `admin_getAccessListByMsgHash` RPC call is not a pure function, it is dependent on system state and therefore less flexible in these situations.

```sh
echo Old greeting
cast call $GREETER_B_ADDRESS "greet()(string)" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_B
```

Show the current greeting.
The message has not been relayed yet, so it's still the old greeting.

```sh
cast send -q $ORIGIN "relayMessage((address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256),bytes)" "($ORIGIN,$BLOCK_NUMBER,$LOG_INDEX,$TIMESTAMP,$CHAIN_ID_A)" $LOG_ENTRY --access-list "$ACCESS_LIST" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_B --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Call [`relayMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L197-L256) to relay the message.

```sh
echo New greeting
cast call $GREETER_B_ADDRESS "greet()(string)" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_B
```

Again, show the current greeting.
Now it's the new one.
