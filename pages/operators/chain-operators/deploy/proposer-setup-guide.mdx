# Spin up your proposer

After you have spun up your sequencer, you need to attach a proposer to post your L2 state roots data back onto L1 so we can prove withdrawal validity. The proposer is a critical component that enables trustless L2-to-L1 messaging and creates the authoritative view of L2 state from L1's perspective.

This guide assumes you already have a functioning sequencer and the necessary L1 contracts deployed using [`op-deployer`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer). If you haven't set up your sequencer yet, please refer to the \[sequencer guide]\(Todo - Add this link when it's live) first.

## Understanding the proposer's role

The proposer (`op-proposer`) serves as a crucial bridge between your L2 chain and L1. Its primary responsibilities include:

*   **State commitment**: Proposing L2 state roots to L1 at regular intervals
*   **Withdrawal enablement**: Providing the necessary commitments for users to prove and finalize withdrawals

The proposer creates dispute games via the `DisputeGameFactory` contract, enabling permissionless challenging of proposed state roots.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your proposer, ensure you have:

**Running infrastructure:**

*   A synced and operational sequencer node
*   Access to a L1 RPC endpoint
*   The rollup node (`op-node`) running and accessible

**From op-deployer deployment:**

*   Successfully deployed L1 contracts using `op-deployer apply`
*   Access to your deployment output (`genesis` and `rollup`) files.

**Security setup:**

*   A dedicated proposer private key

**Network information:**

*   Your L2 chain ID and network configuration
*   L1 network details (chain ID, RPC endpoints)

## Software installation

### Build from source

Clone and build op-proposer

```bash
# If you don't already have the optimism repository from the sequencer setup
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism

# Checkout the latest release tag
git checkout op-proposer/v1.10.0

# Build op-proposer
cd op-proposer
make op-proposer

# Binary will be available at ./bin/op-proposer
```

### Verify installation

```bash
./bin/op-proposer --version
```

## Configuration setup

### 1. Organize your workspace

Create your proposer working directory:

```bash
# Create proposer directory at the same level as your sequencer
mkdir proposer-node
cd proposer-node

# Create scripts directory
mkdir scripts
```

### 2. Extract contract addresses

Extract the necessary contract addresses from your op-deployer output:

```bash
# Extract L1 contract addresses from your op-deployer deployment
cd proposer-node

# Copy the L1 contracts file from op-deployer, update to paths to wherever your `.deployer/state.json` live
cp ../.deployer/state.json .

# Extract the DisputeGameFactory address
GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].disputeGameFactoryProxyAddress')
echo "DisputeGameFactory Address: $GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS"
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create your `.env` file with the actual values:

```bash
# Create .env file with your actual values
# L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URL
L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

# L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
L2_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547

# Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS

# Private key - Replace with your actual proposer private key
PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY

# Proposer configuration
PROPOSAL_INTERVAL=3600s
GAME_TYPE=0
POLL_INTERVAL=20s

# RPC configuration
PROPOSER_RPC_PORT=8560
```

**Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values!

### 4. Get your proposer private key

Extract the proposer private key from your op-deployer intent file:

```bash
# View your intent file to find the proposer private key
cat ~/.deployer/intent.toml

# Look for a section like:
# [chains.my-chain.roles.proposer]
# privateKey = "0x..."
```

## Proposer configuration

Create `scripts/start-proposer.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source .env

# Path to the op-proposer binary we built
../optimism/op-proposer/bin/op-proposer \
  --poll-interval=$POLL_INTERVAL \
  --rpc.port=$PROPOSER_RPC_PORT \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --rollup-rpc=$ROLLUP_RPC_URL \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --private-key=$PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --game-factory-address=$GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  --game-type=$GAME_TYPE \
  --proposal-interval=$PROPOSAL_INTERVAL \
  --num-confirmations=1 \
  --resubmission-timeout=30s \
  --wait-node-sync=true \
  --log.level=info
```

## Starting the proposer

### 1. Verify prerequisites

Ensure your sequencer and op-node are running:

```bash
# Test L1 connectivity
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $L1_RPC_URL

# Test L2 connectivity  
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $L2_RPC_URL

# Test rollup node connectivity
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $ROLLUP_RPC_URL
```

### 2. Start the proposer

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/start-proposer.sh

# Start the proposer
./scripts/start-proposer.sh
```

## Verification

Verify your proposer is working correctly:

### Check proposer status

```bash
# Verify proposer is responsive
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_version","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8560
```

### Monitor dispute games on L1

```bash
# Check latest dispute game count (requires cast from foundry)
cast call $GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS "gameCount()" --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL
```

Monitor your proposer's ETH balance and gas usage to ensure continuous operation.
Your proposer is now operational!
