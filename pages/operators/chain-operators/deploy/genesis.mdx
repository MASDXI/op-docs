# OP Stack genesis creation

<Callout type="info">
  The recommended way to generate genesis and rollup configuration files is using `op-deployer`.
  This ensures standardization and compatibility with the Superchain.
</Callout>

The `op-deployer` tool simplifies the creation of genesis and rollup configuration files (`genesis.json` and `rollup.json`).
These files are crucial for initializing the execution client (`op-geth`) and consensus client (`op-node`) for your network.

The recommended flow for creating a genesis file and rollup configuration file on the OP Stack is as follows:

1.  **Deploy the L1 contracts** using [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer).
2.  **Generate** both the L2 genesis file (`genesis.json`) and the rollup configuration file (`rollup.json`) using op-deployer's `inspect` commands.
3.  **Initialize** your off-chain components (e.g., execution client, consensus client).

## Recommended method: using op-deployer

### Prerequisites

1.  You have installed the `op-deployer` binary following the instructions in [deployer docs](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#installation).
    After installation, extract the `op-deployer` into your `PATH` and `cd op-deployer`.

2.  You have created and customized an intent file in a `.deployer` directory, typically by running:

    ```bash
    ./bin/op-deployer init --l1-chain-id <YOUR_L1_CHAIN_ID> --l2-chain-ids <YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID> --workdir .deployer
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_L1_CHAIN_ID>` and `<YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID>` with their respective values, see a list of [`chainIds`](https://chainid.network/).

3.  You have edited that intent file to your liking (roles, addresses, etc.).

### Step 1: Deploy the L1 contracts

To deploy your chain to L1, run:

```bash
./bin/op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer \
  --l1-rpc-url <RPC_URL_FOR_L1> \
  --private-key <DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX>
```

This command:

*   Reads your intent file in `.deployer/.`
*   Deploys the OP Stack contracts to the specified L1.
*   Updates a local `state.json` file with the results of the deployment.

### Step 2: Generate your L2 genesis file and rollup file

After your L1 contracts have been deployed, generate the L2 genesis and rollup configuration files by inspecting the deployer's `state.json`

```bash
./bin/op-deployer inspect genesis --workdir .deployer <L2_CHAIN_ID> > .deployer/genesis.json
./bin/op-deployer inspect rollup --workdir .deployer <L2_CHAIN_ID> > .deployer/rollup.json
```

*   genesis.json is the file you will provide to your execution client (e.g. op-geth).
*   rollup.json is the file you will provide to your consensus client (e.g. op-node).

### Step 3: Initialize your off-chain components

Once you have `genesis.json` and `rollup.json`:

1.  Initialize op-geth using genesis.json.
2.  Configure op-node with rollup.json.
3.  Set up additional off-chain infrastructure as needed (block explorer, indexers, etc.). For more on architecture, see [Architecture overview](/operators/chain-operators/architecture).
