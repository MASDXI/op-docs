# Creating your own L2 rollup testnet

Welcome to the complete guide for deploying your own OP Stack L2 rollup testnet. This multi-part tutorial will walk you through each component step-by-step, from initial setup to a fully functioning rollup.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is organized into sequential steps that build upon each other:

<Steps>
  ### **[Spin up op-deployer](./op-deployer-setup)**

  Install op-deployer, deploy L1 contracts, and prepare your environment

  ### **[Spin up sequencer](./op-geth-setup)**

  Set up and run op-geth and op-node (the execution and consensus layers)

  ### **[Spin up batcher](./op-batcher-setup)**

  Configure and start op-batcher for L1 data publishing

  ### **[Spin up proposer](./op-proposer-setup)**

  Set up op-proposer for state root submissions

  ### **[Spin up challenger](./op-challenger-setup)**

  Configure op-challenger for dispute resolution monitoring
</Steps>

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a complete OP Stack testnet with:

*   **L1 Smart Contracts** deployed on Sepolia testnet
*   **Execution Client** (op-geth) processing transactions
*   **Consensus Client** (op-node) managing rollup consensus
*   **Batcher** (op-batcher) publishing transaction data to L1
*   **Proposer** (op-proposer) submitting state root proposals
*   **Challenger** (op-challenger) monitoring for disputes

<Callout type="warning">
  **Testnet Only**: This guide is for **testnet deployment only**. Never use the generated keys or configurations in production environments.
</Callout>

## Before You Start

### Required Resources

*   **Sepolia RPC URL** - Get from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
*   **Sepolia ETH** - Get from [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet) (\~2-3 ETH recommended)
*   **Private Keys** - You'll need 5 separate keys for different roles (we'll generate these in the first step)

<Callout type="info">
  **Follow in Order**: Each step builds on the previous one. Start with spinning up op-deployer and complete them sequentially for the best experience.
</Callout>

## Ready to Start?

Now that you understand what you'll be building, let's begin with the first step!
