# Managing the proposer address

This guide explains how to update the proposer address for chains using permissioned fault proofs. 
The proposer is responsible for submitting L2 outputs to L1, which is a critical component of the OP Stack.
You will need access to the [L1ProxyAdmin](/superchain/privileged-roles#l1-proxy-admin) account, before you begin.

## Background

The proposer role is defined in the [`PermissionedDisputeGame.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/PermissionedDisputeGame.sol) contract for chains running permissioned fault proofs. 
When you need to change the proposer address, you must update the implementation for `gametype 1` in the `DisputeGameFactory.sol` contract.

## Steps to Update the Proposer Address

1.  **Identify the current configuration**

    First, confirm that your chain is using permissioned fault proofs by checking the `DisputeGameFactory` contract on your L1.

2.  **Prepare the new implementation**

    You'll need to deploy a new implementation of the `PermissionedDisputeGame.sol` contract with the updated proposer address.

    ```solidity
    // The PermissionedDisputeGame contract defines the proposer
    // https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/PermissionedDisputeGame.sol
    ```

    TODO: Add specific details on preparing the new implementation contract with the updated proposer address. Confirm with Zak if a completely new contract deployment is needed or if there's another method.

3.  **Update the implementation in the DisputeGameFactory**

    Using the L1ProxyAdmin account, call the `setImplementation()` function in the `DisputeGameFactory.sol` contract:

    ```solidity
    // DisputeGameFactory.sol
    function setImplementation(GameType _gameType, address _impl) external;
    ```

    Parameters:

    *   `_gameType`: Use `1` for fault proof games as defined in `Types.sol`
    *   `_impl`: The address of your new implementation with the updated proposer

    TODO: Confirm with Zak if any additional parameters or considerations are needed when calling this function.

4.  **Verify the update**

    After updating the implementation, verify that the change was successful by:

    TODO: Add specific verification steps - how to check that the proposer has been properly updated.

## Important Considerations

*   This operation should be planned carefully as the proposer is a critical component of your rollup.
*   Ensure the new proposer address is valid and properly controlled before making the change.
*   Consider testing the procedure on a testnet before applying to production environments.
*   The L1ProxyAdmin is a highly privileged role - ensure proper access controls are in place.

## Next steps

*   After updating the proposer address, you may need to configure the new proposer node. See the [proposer configuration](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/proposer) for details.
