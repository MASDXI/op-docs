# Superchain Ecosystem repo

The [Superchain ecosystem repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem) is a comprehensive resource of libraries, utilities, and forkable code examples specifically tailored for builders deploying applications on the OP Stack.
The Superchain ecosystem repository was developed to help ease and expedite the development process for all builders working on the OP Stack, helping them deliver value to the community without the necessity of mastering every detail of how the protocol itself operates.

## Getting started

Our initial launch includes a [bridge tutorial](/interop/tutorials/bridge-crosschain-eth) that demonstrates how to bridge ETH and any ERC20 tokens listed in the [Superchain Token List](/superchain/tokenlist). This tutorial serves as a reference for anyone looking to build their own bridge, providing a clearer understanding of how to interact with the protocol on both the L1 and L2 sides.

Additionally, we provide a package containing common utilities essential for developers interacting with both L1 and L2. One such package is [viem-optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/tree/main/packages/viem), which offers utilities for interacting with the OP Stack using the viem library.
